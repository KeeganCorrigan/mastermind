## Instructions for playing MasterMind

* You will enter **p** or **play** to begin a game. You can quit at any time by typing **q** or **quit**. To view the instructions in the game, type in **i** or **instructions**.
* Once the game begins, the computer will generate a sequence of random colors. Don't worry, there's only four to pick from. **(r)ed, (g)reen, (b)lue**, and **(y)ellow**. The computer can generate a code that includes duplicates, like: **red, red, red, red.**
* You will enter your guess in the format:
  * **rygb**
* If you're a cheater, you can cheat at any time during gameplay by typing in **(c)** or **cheat**. But that's pretty uncool.
* If you are incorrect you will be informed about how many colors are in the correct position and how many of your colors the computer sequence contained.
* When you, eventually, guess the correct sequence of colors, you will be informed how long it took, as well as how many guesses you had to take.
* At that point, you will be prompted to play again or quit. The same inputs that worked initially are still valid (**p** or **play**, and **q** or **quit**).
